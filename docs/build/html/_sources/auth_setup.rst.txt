authenticate_new_user
----------------------------------------------------

.. autofunction:: authenticate_user.authenticate_new_user


.. note:: Authentication is only needed to access clinical data endpoints. A web browser and internet access are required for authentication. The auth_token is saved locally between runs, so this function only needs to be run once.
