    "After collecting a sample and determining what sequences are present, we may have a list of several SARS-CoV-2 mutations that we can immediately say are characteristic of a specific variant. However in some cases, we also may have a mutation that is relatively uncommon in most other samples. \n",
    "For example, we can look at small data sample consisting of 10 mutations: (S:A67V, S:DEL69/70, S:E484A, S:N501Y, S:T572N, S:D614G, S:G142D  N:S2Y, S:Q52R, E:L21F, S:G593D). We’ll want a way to find more details about any mutation collected, such as whether we’ve seen the mutation before, when, and where that mutation came from.\n",
